# Form Validator with Vanilla JavaScript


### Deployed using `Netlify`

#### Check the project live [Clicking Here](https://vanilla-javascript-form-validator.netlify.app/).

##### The goal of this project was to practice my pure vanilla JavaScript skills. The highlights for me were when refactoring the initial if statements and the checkEmail function.

##### Also, taylor making reusable functions to validate required inputs, inputs length and matching passords was very cool to learn and do.
